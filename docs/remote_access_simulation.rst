Remote access to simulation parameters
--------------------------------------

*Please note that this functionality should only be used on a trusted
network.*

Certain control over the simulation is also exposed in the shape of an
object named ``simulation`` if Plankton is started with ``-r``. The
simulation can be paused and resumed using the control script:

::

    $ ./plankton-control.py simulation pause
    $ ./plankton-control.py simulation resume

With these commands, the simulation is paused, while the communication
with the device remains responsive. The communication channel (for
example TCP stream server) would still respond to queries and commands,
but they would not be processed by the device. To simulate a complete
loss of connection, another pair of functions is available:

::

    $ ./plankton-control.py simulation disconnect_device
    $ ./plankton-control.py simulation connect_device

This basically shows the opposite effect, the device simulation
continues running, but the communication channel is not processed
anymore and the device appears disconnected.

The speed of the simulation can be adjusted as well, along with the
number of cycles that are processed per second (via the ``cycle_delay``
parameter).

::

    $ ./plankton-control.py simulation speed 10
    $ ./plankton-control.py simulation cycle_delay 0.05

This will cause the twice as many cycles per second to be computed
compared to the default, and the simulation runs ten times faster than
actual time.

It's also possible to obtain some information about the simulation, for
example how long it has been running and how much simulated time has
passed:

::

    $ ./plankton-control.py simulation uptime
    $ ./plankton-control.py simulation runtime

Finally, the simulation can also be stopped:

::

    $ ./plankton-control.py simulation stop

It is not possible to recover from that, as the processing of remote
commands stops as well. The only way to restart the simulation is to run
Plankton again with the same parameters.
